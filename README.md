# IJ_SpindleOrientation
ImageJ plugin to automatically measure spindle orientation during mitosis

Note: This repository is only to share with colleagues that already know how to use the plugin. As a result, this plugin may not work for your particular application, and you wont find a detailed description of how to use it here. (If you are interested, you can contact me by e-mail). 

The repository contains the NetBeans project. If you just want to use the plugin in ImageJ (and not work with it in netbeans), you only need the jar file and libraries located in the dist folder. 

You can open this porject in NetBeans, then edit the code and build the new project with your changes. 
In dist/lib, you find the dependent libraries that must be added into libraries in NetBeans in order to work with the project. 

This is version 1.0 on 02.05.2019.
